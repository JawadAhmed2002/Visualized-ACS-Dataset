# Visualized-ACS-Dataset
For this task, you will work with a survey dataset and use the matplotlib package to visualize data. The data
set you will be working with comes from the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) data. According to
census.gov, ACS “is a mandatory, ongoing statistical survey that samples a small percentage of the population
every year -- giving communities the information they need to plan investments and services.” \
More specifically, you will be using the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample
(PUMS), which census.gov describes as “files [that] are a set of untabulated records about individual people or
housing units.”
You can download the 2013 ACS 1-year PUMS data for Illinois Housing Unit Records here:

You can also access documentation for the PUMS dataset, including the Data Dictionary, here:
